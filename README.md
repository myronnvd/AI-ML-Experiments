# AI-ML Experiments   
This repository contains my first Machine Learning models:  
 **Linear Regression** (Predicting house prices)  
 **Decision Trees** (Understanding overfitting & noise effects)  

##  What I Learned  
- How ML models behave with noise  
- The difference between Linear Regression & Decision Trees  
- How to use GitHub to manage AI projects  

##  Next Steps  
- More AI models (Random Forest, Neural Networks)  
- Explore real-world datasets  
- Deploy models to production
